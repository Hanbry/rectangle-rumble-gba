# rectangle-rumble-gba
This is an under-development Game Boy Advance game built using DevkitPro.

### Requirements
1. Game Boy Advance Emulator or actual hardware
2. DevkitPro installed

### Build
```
cd rectangle-rumble-gba
make
```

### Run
After building, you can run the generated `.gba` file in `/dist` using an emulator of your choice or on actual hardware.

### Why?
Well, there's nothing more low-level in game development than the GBA (ok GB(C) SNES etc but I really want to finish this) and I love, well really love, low-level stuff and game development.
